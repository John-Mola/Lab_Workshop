### What is Markdown and why use it?

> R Markdown provides an authoring framework for data science. You can use a single R Markdown file to both:
>
> * save and execute code
> * generate high quality reports that can be shared with an audience
>
> R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of static and dynamic output formats.

Code and comments in a more readable format, works well with version control repositories (like git), allows to you test code in chunks (clean environment!), and just a whole lot more convenience than back and forth between R and Word (especially when someone critiques your figures!). 

You can `knit` to html, PDF, or Word (probably others, too). 

**Some examples of things in Markdown:**

* This document.
* [My website](http://johnmola.com)
* [My CV](http://johnmola.com/pdfs/Mola_CV.pdf)
* [Every vignette you've ever looked at](https://rforcats.net/)
* [Entire books, slide shows, more....](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html)

### Markdown Basics


#### Code is organized into "chunks"

##### Here's a basic chunk:

```{r}
summary(iris)
qqplot(iris$Petal.Length,iris$Petal.Width)
```

***

##### Here's a chunk with some options applied:

```{r chunk.name, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4,fig.height=4}
summary(iris)
qqplot(iris$Petal.Length,iris$Petal.Width)
```

***

##### These are the most common chunk options...but there's tons.   
(*This is a good time to learn about tab complete!*)

* `include = FALSE` Runs the chunk, but doesn't show results or code.
* `echo = FALSE` Shows the results, but not the code.
* `message = FALSE` Suppresses any messages.
* `warning = FALSE` Suppresses warnings.
* `fig.cap = "blah blah blah"` Easily add a caption to your figures. 

You can also set global options (they apply to all chunks) using `knitr`   
e.g. `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE)`

***

#### You can pass several programming languages to chunks. `bash`, `perl`, `python`, `R`, etc.

```{bash}
ls *.gif
```

***

#### You can make tables easily too (using a package like `knitr` or `pander`)

```{r message=FALSE}
require(pander)
pander(head(iris), caption = "A table made with pander")
```

***

# Oh yeah, 

> you can obviously make block quotes or text that is

**bold** or *italic*, etc. Check out the [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf).

# tidyverse!

***

#### This run-through made using lots of notes from Michael Levy and Ryan Peek!

***

### What is it?

`tidyverse` is really just a collection of packages. There's core packages, which you'll likely use, and then other more specific packages. 

`install.packages(tidyverse)` will install all of the ~20 packages

`library(tidyverse)` attaches the core packages only:

* dplyr
* tidyr
* ggplot2
* readr
* purrr
* tibble

### Follows a consistent philosophy -- Tidy data

Data goes into data frames

* Each type of observation gets a data frame
* Each variable gets a column
* Each observation gets a row

###### Note: This idea should already be really familiar if you use `ggplot2` for making figures...it's a tidyverse package!!

### Practical advantages 

* Incremental steps
* Left to right operations with pipe!
* Human readable
* Consistency
    * Many functions take data_frame first, then piping
    * Easier to read, faster to write
* The defaults aren't dumb (e.g. `utils::write.csv(row.names = FALSE)` = `readr::write_csv()`)

***

## `tibble`

A less clunky version of data frames (also easier to build dummy data when you need help!)

```{r, echo = TRUE}
tdf = tibble(x = 1:1e4
             , y = rnorm(1e4)) # == data_frame(x = 1:1e4, y = rnorm(1e4))
tdf
```

### There's much more with tibbles! Check out the [manual!!](http://tibble.tidyverse.org/)

## Pipes ` %>% `

On a mac type `shift + cmd + m`

On a PC type `shift + ctrl + m`

A pipe just sends the output from the lefthand side of a function to the first argument on the right hand side of the function. 

With pipes

```{r}
sum(1:10) %>% 
  sqrt()
```

Without pipes:

```{r}
sqrt(sum(1:10))
```

or

```{r}
x = sum(1:10)
sqrt(x)
```


***

## `dplyr`

`dplyr` is used to manipulate data (in data frames...).

Five core functions:

* `filter`
* `select`
* `arrange`
* `group_by`
* `summarise`

...there's a bunch more, too. 

***

I got some pigeon racing data from the internet. It's actually a mess, so to fix some of it real quick, let's `select` only the few variables we want. 

```{r pigeon.data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pg = read_csv("pigeon-racing.csv")
```

![](https://dcassetcdn.com/w1k/submissions/237500/237544_940e.jpg)

Let's use `names()` to quickly see the names of the columns

```{r}
names(pg)
```


```{r}
pigeon = select(pg, Breeder, Pigeon, Color, Sex, Speed)
pigeon
```

Let's look at only fast pigeons with `filter`

```{r}
filter(pigeon, Speed > 150, Sex == "H")
```

With base R that's accomplished with...

```{r}
pigeon[pigeon$Speed > 150 & pigeon$Sex == "H", ]
```

Note that the `dplyr` version is less verbose, and doesn't require remembering which side of the comma you're on. Adding additional steps will also be simpler with the `tidy` format. 

Let's look at only female pigeons, and then see which breeder had the fastest pigeons. We can do this adding `group_by` and `summarise`. And we're going to use pipes! 

```{r}
pigeon %>% 
  filter(Sex == "H") %>% 
  group_by(Breeder) %>% 
  summarise(breed.speed = mean(Speed), entries = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(breed.speed))
```

And, of course, if we wanted, we could have done the initial `select` all within a chunk. Plus it works nicely with `ggplot2`. 

```{r}
pg %>% 
  select(Breeder, Pigeon, Color, Sex, Speed) %>% 
  filter(Sex == "H") %>% 
  group_by(Breeder) %>% 
  summarise(breed.speed = mean(Speed), entries = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(breed.speed)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=entries,y=breed.speed,color=Breeder)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Number of Pigeons a Breeder Entered", y = "Mean Speed of a Breeder's Pigeons") +
  theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "none")
```

***

## `tidyr`

`tidyr` can `gather` to make wide tables long, and `spread` to make long tables wide. You're most likely to use `gather`. 

```{r}
religion = read_csv("religion.csv")
religion
```


There's really 3 variables: religion, income, and frequency (sample size, too)

```{r}
religion %>% 
  gather(income, frequency, -religion, -sampleSize) %>% 
  arrange(religion)
```


An example with real data we've all received before. 

```{r}
tricho = read_csv("trichorainfallpollinators.csv")
tricho
```

```{r}

tricho %>% 
  gather(species, count, -num, -treat, -date, -time, -num_flow)

```

Now we can do useful things with it like find visit rate

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tricho_tidy = tricho %>% 
  gather(species, count, -num, -treat, -date, -time, -num_flow) %>% 
  mutate(observation = paste(num,treat,date)) %>% 
  group_by(observation, num_flow) %>% 
  summarise(visits = sum(count)) %>% 
  mutate(visit.rate = (visits/num_flow)/10)

tricho_tidy

require(plotly)
require(viridis)
ggplotly(ggplot(data = tricho_tidy, aes(x = num_flow, y = visit.rate, color = visits, text = paste("Observation:",observation))) + geom_point() + scale_color_viridis() + labs(x = "Number of Flowers", y = "Visits Per Flower Per Minute", color = "Raw Flowers Visited") + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```
